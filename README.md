Try to do a Leetcode if I have time!
It's good to collect and summarize them in one place.
I use Python 3. 

2024-12-03: I usually stare at the questions and have a little math idea for half an hour, then frustrated. So I am seeking a better way to play with Leetcode. Following this map and understand the idea behind is more essential to work on numbers of questions but just copy paste. 

Leedcode Map: 
1. Arrays and Hashing
2. Two Pointers, Stack
3. Binary Search, Sliding Window, Linked List
4. Trees
5. Tries, Heap/Priority Queue, Backtracking
6. Intervals, Greedy, Advanced Graphs, 2-D DP, Bit Manupulation
7. Math and Geometry

Solve one topic and feel comfortable, and then move to the next topic. I will try 4 questions a week.
